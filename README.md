# Gamatalogue

Gamatalogue is a web app that lets you explore and discover video games from various platforms and genres. You can search for games and view detailed information about each game, such as description, screenshots, and more.

Gamatalogue uses the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) to fetch data about the games. The app is built with React and deployed on Render.
